Dwayne and Andrew were both snake-bitten in terms of qualifications throughout the day for their singles play (let's not take too long on this though and spoil the WCC results blog that will come later), but both came through where it really counts and for the first time ever we have a tie for the 4th annual award of the most coveted and sought after prize in the fantasy sports world.

### Further Analysis

1. Dwayne Campbell and Andrew Hutchinson proved the old saying, "there's more than one way to skin a cat, but you still end up with the same amount of crokinole fantasy points." They each had one matching choice in each of the 4 available groups, and one unique selection.

2. Neither Campbell nor Hutchinson picked themselves, which has been the case for the winning team in 2 of the first 3 years of this fantasy competition. Had either selected themselves, or each other, they could have won the fantasy title outright.

3. One impressive note on Hutchinson's selections is that he made them publicly online 3 days before the tournament. Just another bold move from the Pink Shirted CoyoteTM.

4. I'd consider having some sort of tiebreaker question to ensure we have an outright winner, but considering that of the 34 entries this year, there were still a few incorrectly filled out ballots, I'll hold off on doing anything that could add more confusion.

5. Robert Bonnett finished tied for 2nd in the fantasy pool last year, this year he finished tied for 3rd, only missing the top spot by 10 points. Meanwhile, John Bedtelyon comes in with a very impressive debut performance to share the final spot on the podium with Bonnett.

6. I made a significant error as I totally missed that Reid Tracey should have been place in Group C according to the fantasy pool criteria. But clearly so did everyone else as the 12th place finisher at the tournament went completely unselected. He was joined by Brian Simpson as the only other Top 16 finisher to go unselected.

7. The unluckiest entrant this year is Matt Brown. He scored 495 points for 10th place, but had selected Ezra Jantzi, who had switched over to the Cues side (pretty successfully I might add). For Brown, any other selection that finished in the top 30 would have been enough to give him the fantasy crown.

8. Jeremy Herrmann was also unlucky, selecting Greg Pinel who was not in attendance. But he did wisely choose himself (one of only 2 to make that choice to pick up the points for the 11th place finish).

9. The most popular Group A selections were once again Justin Slater and Ray Beierling. Justin was selected on 23 of 34 teams, while Ray was selected on 14. Jon Conrad was under-rated last year, only being picked on 4 teams, and this year it was a similar story as he was picked on 8 teams. But for the second year in a row he proved those doubters wrong with a high finish.

10. Selections from Group B were quite concentrated with Jason Beierling being selected 21 times and Jeremy Tracey selected 15 times. Optimal choices Andrew Hutchinson and Roy Campbell were selected 8 and 5 times respectively.

11. Tom Johnston led Group C selections with 18, followed by Ray Kappes with 11. Dwayne Campbell was picked 8 times and for the 2nd straight year found himself on the "best possible team" list.

12. Group D selections were quite varied with Rob Mader leading the way at 9, and Randy Harris, Cathy Kuepfer and Christina Campbell as popular choices behind.

13. The best possible team selection would have earned 610 points overall and included:

    - Group A: Justin Slater (1st), Jon Conrad (2nd)
    - Group B: Jason Beierling (4th), (Andrew Hutchinson (5th) OR Roy Campbell (8th))
    - Group C: Dwayne Campbell (7th), Tom Johnston (6th)
    - Group D: Jeremy Herrmann (11th), Reid Tracey (12th)

Thanks to all for participating once again and enjoying the little extra entertainment value that this fantasy pool offers in addition to the World Championship tournament.
