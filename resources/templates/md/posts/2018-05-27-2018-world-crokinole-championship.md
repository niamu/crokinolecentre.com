Did you not pick Vegas in your Stanley Cup bracket and are starting to feel a little foolish? Well, you're not alone. Is your knowledge of the professional crokinole circuit vastly superior to that of the NHL? Well, join the club.

Join the club of people willing to put their ego on the line that is, by filling out a roster for the 2018 WCC Fantasy Pool.

Last year, Nathan Walsh became Fantasy Pool champion, joining the esteemed ranks alongside Roy Campbell and Clare Kuepfer as previous winners. Will one of them become the first two-time champion? Will there be new champion? Will it be you? You will get to play a part in deciding if that is the case.

The rules are simple (and the same as ever):

1. Pick the best 8 player team consisting of:
    - 2 players from Group A
    - 2 players from Group B
    - 2 players from Group C
    - and 2 players from Group D.
2. The higher up your players finish, the more points your team earns.
3. Whoever has the team with the most points will win the coveted title of Crokinole Fantasy Champion, and bragging rights until their title is challenged next year.

NOTE: Fantasy Pool results are limited to the Competitive Singles category.

The separation into 4 different groups is designed to spread out the talent, so a the winning team will require a strong showing from many different players who outperform their expectations.

This year, the groups were divided based on 2018 NCA Tournament results.

- Group A - Any player with a victory on the 2017/2018 NCA Tour.
- Group B - Any player who finished in the Top 4 of a 2017/2018 NCA tournament.
- Group C - Any player who finished in the Top 8 of a 2017/2018 NCA doubles event, or Top 12 of an NCA singles event.
- Group D - Any player not listed in Groups A, B or C. As a guide, a list of notable players have been provided.
