The sun was shining over the Okanagan valley to greet the 30 participants to this year's tournament. As always, the day was started with a visit by Oliver's mayor Ron Hovanes, who returned later in the day to watch the singles finals and present the awards. Play got started with a five game round robin of doubles play. There were six teams in the competitive side and nine teams on the recreational division. After the first five games, the top four teams played again on the competitive side to determine the finalists. After losing the first game in a best of three set, Linda Irvine and Quin Erzinger rallied to become this year's doubles victors over Ralph Hargrave and last year's singles champion Adrian Conradi.

Following the round robin, the recreational division reduced to six teams who played again to reach the finals. BC has some very skilled youngsters playing, evidence to this was the combined age of 25 years between sisters Saje and Petal Good who prevailed over the father-son team of Gordon and Jeremy Gunn to take the recreational crown. Gordon and Susan Gunn were the lone representatives from Ontario, hailing from Owen Sound.

After a break for lunch, singles play got started. This year brought a rule change to the system. After playing the ten game round robin, the top 20 shooter was Quin Erzinger with 91. The top four scores on the competitive side (in descending order) belonged to Quin Erzinger, Jody Good, Jordan Ripley, and Ralph Hargrave. They advanced to play each other again to determine the finalists. Ralph Hargraves lost to Jordan Ripley in the bronze final. First place was a rematch from the 2013 tournament. In a thrilling final which involved extra rounds and trick shot 20s, Jody Good defeated Quin Erzinger to take his first singles championship.

In the recreational division, Wilf Paul won third place over Petal Good, with Saje Good claiming the first place title over Jeremy Gunn.

The number of registrants may have declined from last year, but the enthusiasm only ever grows for this tournament, especially from the recreational division. We are looking to host an even better Championship next year in Oliver on the 5th of March, and I hope to see you there!

#### Author's note:

This year's tournament may not have seen many faces from afar, but the local talent has taken a huge step forward in the amount of strategy and skill that was employed during competitive play. Personally, I can say it was a bittersweet pleasure to witness the improvement in Jody Good's play, and I commend him for the exhilarating final this year.
