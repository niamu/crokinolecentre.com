Crokinole action from the 2009 World Championships in Tavistock, Ontario, on June 6. Part 1 of the championship finals between Brian Cook and Nathan Walsh. More information about the championships is available on worldcrokinole.com and many other sites such as worldcrokinoleleague.com, and crokinoledepot.com.

There is a mistake in the introduction. Cook is actually on the left and Walsh on the right. For more from CrokinoleCentre, find full tournament previews and reviews at http://crokinolecentre.blogspot.ca
