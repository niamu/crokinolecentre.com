This Saturday October 27, 2012, Brucefield will be the host of this year's Ontario Doubles Crokinole Championships (ODCC). One of the best NCA tour stops in the year will once again hold the best doubles talent around. The two-time defending Ontario Doubles Champs are the Toronto pairing of Brian Cook and Fred Slater. They've claimed the only two ODCC titles with wins over Jon Conrad and Barry Kiggins in 2010, and over Eric Miltenburg and Joe Arnup in 2011. CrokinoleDepot's own Raymond and Jason Beierling have twice finished in the top 4.

The tournament title is of great importance as all winning prize money is donated to the top team to attend the following BC Provincial Crokinole Championships held in March. In 2011 Fred Slater used his bid to score a second place in the singles category of the 2011 BC tournament. In 2012 Brian Cook and Fred Slater attended the event and scored a doubles victory followed by a 1-2 finish in the singles division.

This year's tournament may prove to be the best yet. Jon Conrad and Tony Snyder may not team up, but both return as World Doubles Champions. Fred Slater and Brian Cook return as the Ontario and British Columbia Doubles Champions, while Fred Slater also recently finished 2nd in the doubles category at the World Championships. 6-time World Champions, the Beierling Brothers will attempt to improve on two consecutive top 4 finishes at the Ontario Championships. They arrive at the tournament after a 7th place finish in doubles at the World Championships and a 4th and 5th place finish in the singles competition. Ron and Ray Haymes come in to the tournament as the 3rd best doubles team in the World. Clare Kuepfer will come in as one half of the PEI Provincial Doubles Championship team. And the Belleville club will arrive having put two teams into the top 4 of the World Championships in the last two years as Dave and Matt Brown finished 2nd in 2011 and Louis Gauthier and Chris Gorsline finished 4th is 2012. Eric Miltenburg and Joe Arnup will look to avenge their finals loss in 2012. And the best part about the ODCC is that there is always a couple of teams, that you would never have expected, who will make an impact.

Either way, get your game face on, and your strategy prepared for the 2012 Ontario Doubles Crokinole Championships.
