Back by popular demand, the WCC Fantasy Pool has returned for another round of wild speculation, bold prediction and seething crokinole players looking to destroy you after you left them off your list.

The 2015 Fantasy Pool victor was Clare Kuepfer, with co-2nd-place finishers of Fred Slater and Jon Conrad. Their prediction prowess proved preferable, but it is time to challenge those assertions, start your player analysis, and submit your Fantasy team once again.

The rules are simple (and the same as last year): 
1. Pick the best 8 player team consisting of:
    - 2 players from Group A
    - 2 players from Group B
    - 2 players from Group C
    - and 2 players from Group D.
2. The higher up your players finish, the more points your team earns.
3. Whoever has the team with the most points will win the coveted title of Crokinole Fantasy Champion, and bragging rights until their title is challenged next year.

NOTE: Fantasy Pool results are limited to the Competitive Singles category.

The separation into 4 different groups is designed to spread out the talent, so a winning team will require a strong showing from many different players, who outperform their expectations.

Last year a ranking system was used to divide up the four groups, but due to some flaws in the rankings it was clearly far from perfect. This year, the groups are divided on a more simplistic basis where Group A consists tournament winners in the past year, Group B are top 16 finishers from the 2015 WCC, and Group C are top 40 finishers from the 2015 WCC. Group D consists of any players not listed in any of the previous groups.
