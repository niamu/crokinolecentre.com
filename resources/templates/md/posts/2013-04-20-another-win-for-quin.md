On March 16th 2013, a very enthusiastic group of crokinole players gathered at the Oliver BC Recreational Centre, for a day of crokinole competition. Players came from Alberta, Manitoba, State of Washington, and Ontario, as well as BC.

Registration opened at 7:15 AM. Competitive and recreational doubles began at 8:15 with 12 teams in the competitive division, 14 teams in the recreational division, playing 5 games each. The top 6 teams in each division advanced to a round robin, with the the top 2 teams playing off for the doubles championship. 

In the competitive division this pitted Jody Good and Mike Hughes against Linda Irvine and Ralph Hargraves, with Linda and Ralph taking the championship. Third place went to Ed Erzinger and son Quin Erzinger and fourth to Ed Ripley and son Jordon. Fifth and sixth went to the two teams with Ontario ties as and followed by Joe Arnup & sister Val Arnup grabbed fifth, Cathy & Clare Kuepfer took sixth. A real family affair. In the Rec. division, Mark Siemans & Vic Jensen took 1st, Darin & Arleigh Fair 2nd. 

After a break for lunch, door prizes and the silent auction, the singles competition began with 22 players in the competitive division and 24 in the recreational division. After playing 10 games each, the top 8 moved on to the round robin playoffs. 

Making the top eight were perennial favourites Quin Erzinger, Linda Irvine, and Adrian Conradi. Also rolling into the top 8 Jordon Ripley, Jody Good and Brian Wensley, and from Ontario, Clare Kuepfer and Joe Arnup. Advancing to the top 4 were Linda Irvine, Adrian Conradi, Quin Erzinger and Jody Good, with 5th through eighth being Joe Arnup, Clare Kuepfer, Brian Wensley and Jordon Ripley respectively.

In the top 4 Linda Irvine and Adrian Conradi played for 3rd and 4th, with Linda taking 3rd place and Adrian 4th.

Quin Erzinger and Jody Good played for the singles championship. Jody took 2nd place and Quin emerged as the winner of the tournament for the second time in 3 years (2011 and 2013). 

Nancy Clarke won the Rec. singles and Mark Siemens took 2nd.

This year the event was run by Ed Ripley and his very competent group of organizers. They did a great job, and I believe the tournament has been turned over to crokinole enthusiasts who will grow the BC tournament to bigger and better things. Of course "Crokinole Cliff" was also in attendance for the day, keeping an eye on things, to make sure it was done right.

This has been a great experience, and one I would encourage everyone to take in some time. On Sunday, (Mar. 17) Cathy and I stopped by to see Cliff and Joyce for a wonderful visit. Cliff certainly has put great effort into promoting crokinole and his tournament in British Columbia. Crokinole is alive and well, and very competitive in BC!!

"Thank You" BC for a great time!
