CrokinoleCentre's main function is to record, edit and create crokinole videos on the YouTube channel "lshgmail"

Although I have footage for the PEI and St. Jacob's championship matches, they will not be posted until after the World Crokinole Championships on June 2nd in Tavistock.

The delay is obviously due to the World Championships as most of my effort will be concentrated on practicing, and creating promotional videos for the tournament.

The first video has been made and can be viewed right here. I plan on making a longer one soon.

But if you can't wait for that try watching a few that I made last year.
